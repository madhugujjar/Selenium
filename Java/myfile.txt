if we make a class as final it cant be inherited
if we make a method as final it cant be overridden
if we make a field as final it cant be changed it is called constant
final veriable have to be intitalised then and there itself 

u cant create and object of and interface so Interface cant have instance variables. Interface is also a class

Instance variables canbe accessed by creating objects(instance of it)

if u want to access a variable without creating object of it, is called static variable

A variable inside an Interface by default is public static final(even if u remove this public static final ) its default
ex:public static final int i=50;

finally{} is a block which can be executed if the exception occurs or not
but it should have a try{} block

finalize() is a method which can be excuted before it is garbage collected

if a overriden method is there it should not throw a extra exeception are in the 
super class
the overridden method in subclass may or may not throw exception which is in super class

if super class constractor is throwing an exception the sub class should throw an exception. subclass cannot handle it through try catch block

difference between Exception and Errors
when exception occurs we can handle it, but when errors occur we cant handle it

Errors are not due to our programm but it is on what the envirnoment it is running

if i want to allocate some memory to my program i can give the minimum and maximum size
xms stand for initial Heep-size
java -Xms256m  -Xms1024 com.accenture.x

if you want to write primitive data types in a file u cannot write it with BufferedoutputStream there is another object called PrintStream
